NR-XBee
=======

Node-RED module to support use of XBee wireless modules.
Right now this is an exact fork of freakent's [NR-XBee](https://github.com/freakent/NR-XBee).
However, instead of [svd-xbee](https://github.com/jouz/svd-xbee), I'd like to use [xbee-api](https://github.com/jouz/svd-xbee) in the future.

Pre-requesites
--------------
1. Node-RED's serial module must be enabled
1. Install xbee-api from npm

    $ npm install xbee-api
